	abstract = {This paper presents the latest results on confinement studies in the TJ-II stellarator. The inherently strong plasma–wall interaction of TJ-II has been successfully reduced after lithium coating by vacuum evaporation. Besides H retention and low Z , Li was chosen because there exists a reactor-oriented interest in this element, thus giving special relevance to the investigation of its properties. The Li-coating has led to important changes in plasma performance. Particularly, the effective density limit in NBI plasmas has been extended reaching central values of 8 × 10{\textasciicircum}19 m{\textasciicircum}−3 and T\_e ≈ 250 – 300 eV, with peaked density, rather flat T e profiles and higher ion temperatures. Due to the achieved density control, a second type of transition has been added to the low density ones previously observed in ECRH plasmas: higher density transitions characterized by the fall in Hα emission, the onset of steep density gradient and the reduction in the turbulence; which are characteristics of transition to the H mode. Confinement studies in ECH plasmas indicate that lowest order magnetic resonances, even in a low shear environment, locally reduce the effective electron heat diffusivities, while Alfven eigenmodes destabilized in NBI plasmas can influence fast ion confinement.},

This concept seems to be most suitable for this flexible stellarator in which the positions and the order of the resonances can be varied. As a first step, a family of configurations that exhibit flux expansion is identified. Then, a three-dimensional map of the collisional particle flux has been obtained for two different plasma regimes using the full- f Monte Carlo code ISDEP (Integrator of Stochastic Differential Equations in Plasmas), which computes the ion guiding-centre trajectories. The particle trajectories rather than the field lines must be considered since ion orbits can drift from the field lines in TJ-II and the plasma electric field and the collisionality must be considered in such calculations. We have checked that it is possible to strongly reduce the heat and particle fluxes by intercepting the trajectories at a given zone of the space. These calculations are done for thermal ions and for fast particles coming from the neutral beam injection heating. Future studies, possibly including the creation of an ergodic zone, will determine the best strategy for intercepting the trajectories.},

By means of this technique, several MHD modes could be identified in discharges with a spontaneous confinement transition in different but similar magnetic configurations. The configurations differed mainly with respect to the radial position of the rational surfaces, thus allowing the reconstruction of a poloidal mode rotation profile based on the mode activity, which was found to be consistent with earlier work. The detected mode spectrum also provided an explanation for the bicoherence observed in one of the configurations after the confinement transition. Both the mode spectrum and the velocity profile were closely reproduced by nonlinear resistive MHD calculations in simplified geometry. As a consequence, the magnetic Reynolds stress is hypothesized to play an important role in the establishment of the velocity shear layer in TJ-II and the concomitant confinement transition.},

	abstract = {The basic concepts of the controlled thermonuclear program at Project Matterhorn, Princeton University are discussed. In particular, the theory of confinement of a fully ionized gas in the magnetic configuration of the stellarator is given, the theories of heating are outlined, and the bearing of observational results on these theories is described.
Magnetic confinement in the stellarator is based on a strong magnetic field produced by solenoidal coils encircling a toroidal tube. The configuration is characterized by a ``rotational transform,'' such that a single line of magnetic force, followed around the system, intersects a cross‐sectional plane in points which successively rotate about the magnetic axis. A theorem by Kruskal is used to prove that each line of force in such a system generates a toroidal surface; ideally the wall is such a surface. A rotational transform may be generated either by a solenoidal field in a twisted, or figure‐eight shaped, tube, or by the use of an additional transverse multipolar helical field, with helical symmetry.
Plasma confinement in a stellarator is analyzed from both the macroscopic and the microscopic points of view. The macroscopic equations, derived with certain simplifying assumptions, are used to show the existence of an equilibrium situation, and to discuss the limitations on material pressure in these solutions. The single‐particle, or microscopic, picture shows that particles moving along the lines of force remain inside the stellarator tube to the same approximation as do the lines of force. Other particles are presumably confined by the action of the radial electric field that may be anticipated.
Theory predicts and observation confirms that initial breakdown, complete ionization, and heating of a hydrogen or helium gas to about 10{\textasciicircum}6 degrees K are possible by means of a current parallel to the magnetic field (ohmic heating). Flow of impurities from the tube walls into the heated gas, during the discharge, may be sharply reduced by use of an ultra‐high vacuum system; some improvement is also obtained with a divertor, which diverts the outer shell of magnetic flux away from the discharge. Experiments with ohmic heating verify the presence of a hydromagnetic instability predicted by Kruskal for plasma currents greater than a certain critical value and also indicate the presence of other cooperative phenomena. Heating to very much higher temperatures can be achieved by use of a pulsating magnetic field. Heating at the positive‐ion cyclotron resonance frequency has been proposed theoretically and confirmed observationally by Stix. In addition, an appreciable energy input to the positive ions should be possible, in principle, if the pulsation period is near the time between ion‐ion collisions or the time required for a positive ion to pass through the heating section (magnetic pumping).},

This characteristic makes this stellarator a suitable device to study the impact of unfavourable magnetic well conditions on plasma performance and stability. The here reported experiments explored a family of ten magnetic configurations with a similar rotational transform and varying magnetic well, from positive to negative values, hence exploring Mercier-unstable configurations. We succeeded in developing reproducible NBI-heated plasmas, even when the most Mercier-unstable configurations were performed, although the turbulence level was higher in the latter configurations. The position of the plasma boundary agreed with the equilibrium calculations in all cases.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the results from experiments in HSX testing the properties of a quasisymmetric stellarator. HSX is a quasihelical stellarator with minimal toroidal curvature and a high effective transform. The high effective transform was verified from passing particle orbits as well as from the magnitude of the Pfirsch-Schlüter and bootstrap currents. The passing particle orbit shift, the helical structure of the Pfirsch-Schlüter current and the direction of the bootstrap current were all consistent with the lack of toroidal curvature. Good agreement was observed between data from plasma currents obtained by a set of magnetic pick-up coils and the results of the V3FIT code. Good confinement of trapped particles was observed with quasisymmetry. These particles may be responsible for a coherent global MHD mode that was detected during ECH at B = 0.5 T. It was found that the breaking of quasisymmetry increased the hollowness of the density profile and the damping of plasma flow while decreasing the core electron temperature, in good agreement with neoclassical models. At 0.5 T, anomalous transport appeared unaffected by the degree of quasisymmetry; more work is need to understand if this still holds at 1.0 T. The experimental energy confinement time and electron temperature profile could be reproduced reasonably well with a combination of neoclassical transport and a modified Weiland model for ITG/TEM turbulence.},
